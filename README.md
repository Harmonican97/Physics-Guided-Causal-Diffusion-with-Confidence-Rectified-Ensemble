Physics-Guided Causal Diffusion with Confidence-Rectified Ensemble for Generalized Zero-Shot Compound Fault Diagnosis Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics

📝 Abstract
Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) in machinery fault diagnosis aims to identify novel compound faults (unseen) using only single-fault data (seen). We propose PGCD-CRE, a framework that bridges the semantic gap through physical causality.
